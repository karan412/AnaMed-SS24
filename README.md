# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with K-Means Clustering
Project Description

This project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set to perform various statistical analyses and machine learning tasks, particularly focusing on clustering techniques to diagnose breast cancer. The dataset includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, which describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

# Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle. It contains 569 samples of malignant and benign tumor cells, with 30 real-valued features for each sample.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy

# Analysis
The project includes the following analyses:

- Univariate Analysis: Statistical summary and visualization of individual features.
- Bivariate Analysis: Comparison of features with respect to the diagnosis.
- Correlation Analysis: Calculation and visualization of the correlation matrix.
- K-Means Clustering: Implementation of K-Means clustering to group similar data points.
- Evaluation of Clustering: Mapping of cluster labels to actual diagnosis and evaluation of clustering accuracy.

# Results
Key results from the analysis include:

- Visualizations of the distribution of features.
- Box plots showing the differences between benign and malignant tumors.
- Heatmap of the correlation matrix.
- Accuracy of the K-Means clustering model in predicting the diagnosis.
